# Python-introduction
Python Overview 

# What is Python
Python is a dynamically typed, General Purpose Prograomming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.

Python is also an interpreted and high-level programming language.

It was created by Guido Van Rossum is 1989.

# Features of Python
    Python is simple and easy to understand.
    It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
    Python is an open-source programming language.
    Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
    Its is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

# What is Python Used for
Python is used in Data Visulization to create plots and graphical represntations.
Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
It is used in AI and Machine learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
It is used to create web applications.
It can be used to handle databases.
It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathmatcal operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

# Installation & Getting Started
#Steps to Install Python:
a.Vsisit the official python website:https:/www.python.org/

b.Download the executable file based on your Operating System and version specifications.

c.Run the executable file and complete the installation proccess.

# Version:
After installation check the version of python by typing following command:
â€˜python --versionâ€™.

# Starting Python:
Open Python IDE or any other text editors of your preferred choice. Let's understand
python code execution with the simplest print statement.
Type the following in the IDE:

 print("Hello World !!!")

Now save the file with a.py extension and Run it. You will got the following output:

    Hello World !!!

# Installing Packages:
To install packages in Python, we use the pip command.
e.g. pip install "Packages Name"
Following command installs pandas package in Python

    pip intall pandas

We will learn more about the pip command in the chapter dedicated to pip.   


# What is Syntax?
In simplest words, syntax is the arragment of words and phrases to create
well-formed sentances in a language. In the case of a computer language, the
syntax is the structural arrangement of comments, variables, numbers, 
operators, statements, loops, functions, classes, objects, etc. Which helps us
understand the meaning or semantics of a computer language.

For E.g. a 'comment' is used to explain the functioning of a block of code. It starts
with a '#'.
More on comments in the comments chapter.

For E.g. a block of code is identified by an 'indentation'. Have a look at the 
following code, here print(i) is said to be indented with respect to the link above 
it. In simple words, indentation is the addition of spaces before the line "print(i)"

    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

# Python Comments
A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to executed,
rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of 
a specific part of code while tesing.  

# Single-Line Comments:
To write a comment just add a "#" at the start of the line.
Example 1:

    #This is a 'Single-Line Comment'
    print("This is a print statement.")


Output:

    This is a print statement.


Example 2:

    print("Hello World !!!")   #Printing Hello World

Output:

        Hello World

Example 3:

        print("Python Program)
        #print("Python Program)

Output:

        Python Program


# Multi-Lilne Comments:
To write multi-line comments you can use '#' at each line or you can use the multine string.
Example 1:The use '#'

    #It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
    #If the condition is false than it will execute another block of code.
    p = 7
    if (p > 5):
        print("p is greater than 5.")
    else:
        print("p is not greater than 5.")    

Output:

    p is greater than 5.
